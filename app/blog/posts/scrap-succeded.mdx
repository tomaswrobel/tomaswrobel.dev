{description} The success proves that Scrap is a great tool for programming education.

### Student Programming Showcase of Projects

<q lang="cs">Student programming Showcase of projects</q> (SPSP) is an annual event that allows students to present their
programs and projects. It is held at the GVOZ and this year there was a record number of programs entered, and I was already
afraid that I would not succeed this time.

### Scrap 4

[Scrap](/blog/scrap.mdx) is an alternative of Scratch that allows you to write code in a text as well as in a block
editor. Scrap 4 was released in 2023 and it was a big step forward, while being published just in time for the SPSP.
Unlike Scrap 3, it introduced:

#### TypeScript

Scrap 4 supports TypeScript, which means that Scrap is now a truly strong-typed language. TypeScript is a language that
is compiled into JavaScript. It's just an extension of JavaScript, so anything JavaScript can do, TypeScript can do.
This was not a burden for Scrap because it was already using Babel, which has TypeScript support built in.

#### Monaco Editor

Scrap 4 uses the editor from Visual Studio Code, which makes the use of TypeScript even more useful. It helps with
autocomplete and linting. To make matters worse, the Monaco editor is set up so that the text color matches the block
colors. (Thanks to my classmate Vítek for this idea.) But for proper autocomplete, I had to write my own TypeScript
definitions, which was quite a chore. And not only for the Scrap engine, but also for ECMAScript APIs (such as arrays
and numbers), because otherwise the Monaco editor would allow insanely complicated structures that can't be converted to
blocks, and aren't needed in Scrap anyway (classes, DOM manipulation, ...).

### The success

The success of Scrap Scrap won the audience award. It means that the other contestants liked Scrap the most. And that's
a huge honor for me. I should add that traditionally some of the contestants use Scratch, so Scrap was a new experience
for them. And I won the jury prize. In the end, the jury awarded it to all the losers in my category, because they
thought all the programs were great and almost incomparable. It's hard to judge high school students when everyone uses
different language and is at a different level. Still, I'm glad I won, at least in front of the audience.

### Fun fact

Even though I didn't get 1<sup>st</sup>&ndash;3<sup>rd</sup> place, thanks to the audience I got a higher prize in total
than the 1<sup>st</sup> place winner.
