### PHP

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. Fast, flexible and
pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

### Hello, World!

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

### How I used PHP

I did not. There are better alternatives full-stack web development, such as Next.js.
