### Why I haven't been posting

I haven't been posting for a while. I was busy with my studies and my job as a tutor. Yes! Ironically, I was too busy to
post about my job as a tutor for children who prepare for the admission to the
[gymnasium](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)>) (a type of secondary school in Europe).

These exams consists of two parts: a math test and a Czech language test. The math test is quite challenging, as it
requires a lot of logical thinking and problem-solving skills. The Czech language test is also quite difficult, as it
requires a good understanding of grammar and each primary school teaches in a different way.

### The job experience

I've been an employee of tutoring company [Vzdělávací centrum doučse, z. s.](https://doucse.cz/) since August 2024. I
was quite excited about it, as I thought it would be a great opportunity to share my knowledge and help others. However,
I quickly realized that being an employee has some rules and I'm glad I've learned them quickly.

### Still a coder in my heart

Maths is an essential part of programming. I often find myself solving problems that require a deep understanding of
mathematics. That way, I could help my students with their math problems and also teach them how to think logically and solve problems
in a systematic way. 

And as they often asked for some math exercises, I made a whole website for them. I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
and [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) to create a simple website with math exercises. That way, I still could code and 
help my students at the same time.
