### Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android,
iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language
and follows the reactive programming style.

### Hello, World!

```dart
class HelloWorld extends StatelessWidget {
	@override
	Widget build(BuildContext context) {
		return Center(
			child: Text('Hello, World!'),
		);
	}
}
```
