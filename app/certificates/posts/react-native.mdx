### React Native

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for
Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows, and UWP from a single codebase. React Native uses the JavaScript
programming language and allows developers to build mobile applications using React.

### Hello, World!

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {Text, View} from "react-native";

const HelloWorld = () => (
	<View>
		<Text>Hello, World!</Text>
	</View>
);

export default HelloWorld;
```

### How I used React Native

Well, I did not as React Native is really limited in terms of what I can do with it. I prefer Flutter for mobile
applications, and as I make hybrid applications, I use web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for web applications,
often with React.
