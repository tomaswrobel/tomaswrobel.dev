### Front End Development Libraries

Front end development libraries are collections of pre-written code that help developers build web applications faster
and more efficiently. These libraries provide reusable components, tools, and utilities that can be easily integrated
into projects. Some popular front end development libraries include:

-   React
-   jQuery
-   Vue.js
-   Angular
-   Svelte

### How I used Front End Development Libraries

I use React, especially with Next.js, to build modern web applications. I do not use jQuery as much as I used to, and I
have experimented with Vue.js and Angular in the past. I have not used Svelte yet, but I am interested in learning it.

The course itself was focused on jQuery, React and Redux.
