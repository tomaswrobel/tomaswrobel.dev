### TypeScript

TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is
designed for the development of large
applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. It may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and
server-side execution.

### Hello, World!

```typescript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### How I used TypeScript

I use it everywhere instead of JavaScript! I'm really enjoying the benefits of TypeScript, such as type checking, interfaces,
and enums. IntelliSense is also a great feature that helps me write code faster and with fewer errors.
