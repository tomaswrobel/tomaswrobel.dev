### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for
React-based web applications. It is designed to be extensible and customizable, allowing developers to build modern web
applications with ease.

### Hello, World!

```tsx
import type {FunctionComponent} from "react";

const Home: FunctionComponent = () => (
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>Hello, World!</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
		</body>
	</html>
);

export default Home;
```
