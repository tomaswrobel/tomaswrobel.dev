### Scrap Contribution Needed

[Scrap](https://github.com/tomaswrobel/scrap) is a tool that simplifies the transition from block-based programming to JavaScript.

Scrap uses these technologies:

* Rust, TypeScript and Sass
* Blockly as a block editor
* Monaco Editor as a text editor
* SWC as compiler from user code to JavaScript
* Tauri as a desktop application framework

I can't maintain Scrap alone. I need your help to improve the tool. If you are interested in contributing to Scrap, please get in touch with me.
You can use email [scrap@tomaswrobel.dev](mailto:scrap@tomaswrobel.dev), [GitHub](https://github.com/tomaswrobel/), or any other way you prefer.
