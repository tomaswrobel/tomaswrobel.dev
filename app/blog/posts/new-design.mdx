### What's new?

-   🎨 **Aesthetic overhaul:** The website now offers a stunning visual transformation with a harmonious blend of
    colors, updated graphics, and a clean layout.
-   🚀 **Improved navigation:** Navigation has been redesigned for better intuitiveness, making it easier for you to
    find the information you need.
-   💡 **Enhanced responsiveness:** Whether you are using a computer, tablet, or smartphone, the website smoothly adapts
    to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and pleasant experience.

### What's new in programming?

-   **🚀 Now powered by Next.js:** The new design is created using Next.js, bringing a new level of dynamic
    functionality and interactivity. This update improves overall performance and user experience.
-   **🌐 Still open-source:** I am excited that the code behind the website remains open source. You can explore and
    contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomaswrobel/tomaswrobel.dev).

### Explore the old design

Curious about the previous version of the website? You can still access it [here](https://tomaswrobel.github.io/). It
serves as an example of a website without JavaScript, and since it is open-source, I decided to keep it online.

### What's next?

There will be more extensive changes with this website. What do you think about the new design? Your thoughts are always
welcome!
