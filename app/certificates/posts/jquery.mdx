### JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a
multi-paradigm language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

### Hello, World!

```javascript
$("body").append("Hello, World!");
```

### How I used jQuery

I did not. It's outdated and does not bring any value to modern web development.
