### Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window
or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD.
Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.

This different from Adaptive Web Design, which is a design methodology aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal
viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of
devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones). So rather than available sizes, we are talking about
available designs

Responsive: Reacts to the size of the screen Adaptive: I use Material on mobile, Fluent on Windows, and Cupertino on iOS
