### React + Redux

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native),
and are easy to test.

### How I used React + Redux

-   Web Development
-   Hybrid Mobile App Development
-   Hybrid Desktop App Development

Note: I do not use Redux that much. I prefer to use React's Context API for state management.
