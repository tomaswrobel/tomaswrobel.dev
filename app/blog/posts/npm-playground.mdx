	"NPM Playground is a tool for developers who want to quickly test code online. It supports NPM packages, multiple files, and much more.";

There are many <q>code playgrounds</q> on the internet, but very few of them support NPM packages. And if they do, they
are either paid or huge. That's why I decided to create NPM Playground.

## NPM Package Support

You can import NPM packages using `import`, but not `require`.

```js
import $ from "jquery";

$("body").css("background-color", "#FF0");
```

## Multiple File Support

NPM Playground supports multiple files that can be linked using ECMAScript `import` / `export`. But be careful &ndash;
you must exclude these extensions:

-   .js
-   .jsx
-   .ts
-   .tsx

So if there is a file called `counter.tsx`, the import must be `"./counter"`:

index.tsx

```tsx
import Counter from "./counter";

/// ....
```

counter.jsx

```jsx
export default function Counter({count}) {
	return <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>;
}
```

## Archivace projektu

Project was archived in favor of [PlayGist](playgist.mdx). That means it won't receive updates, but it will still be
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomaswrobel/npm-playgound).
