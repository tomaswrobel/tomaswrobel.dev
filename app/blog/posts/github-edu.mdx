### GitHub Education

GitHub Education is a program that offers students and teachers a number of benefits and tools for learning and software
development. Among the main benefits are the ability to get free access to GitHub Pro, GitHub Copilot, GitHub
Codespaces, and other tools. Thanks to this, students and teachers can create, share, and manage their projects and
codes.

### Benefits of GitHub Education

GitHub Education also has partners, such as Heroku, AWS, JetBrains, DigitalOcean.

For example, JetBrains offers its IDEs to students for free, AWS provides students with credits for its services, and
DigitalOcean offers students and teachers a discount on its services.

### GitHub Student Developer Pack

Since I study at Wichterle's Grammar School, all I needed was a confirmation of my studies or an ISIC. Thanks to the
initiative of classmates with whom I shared, now only a school email is enough, because they managed to include
Wichterle's Grammar School among the supported schools.

### GitHub Copilot

Personally, the biggest advantage is GitHub Copilot. Copilot is an AI tool that completes the code for you. Just write a
comment and Copilot will complete the code for you.

```python
# Creating an array with random numbers
array = [random.randint(0, 100) for i in range(10)]
```

Since I program the web in Next.js, this paragraph was generated for me by GitHub Copilot. So it can handle natural
language. And he chose the code himself (I wanted TypeScript ðŸ˜¢).

### GitHub Pro

GitHub Pro is a paid version of GitHub that offers a number of benefits.

I use the badge to show everyone that I am PRO. But more importantly for me, I don't have to have public repositories to
host them on GitHub Pages.

### GitHub Codespaces

I am slightly concerned about GitHub Codespaces. It is VS Code in the cloud, which boasts that it is <q>faster than your
computer</q>. However, GitHub only doubles the free hours for students, which is not enough for long-term use of fast
Codespaces.

### Conclusion

I am satisfied with GitHub Education, and I am glad that they are still improving it. I conclude with a 9/10.
