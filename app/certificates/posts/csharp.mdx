### C# (C Sharp)

C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for developing
desktop applications, web applications, and games. C# is part of the .NET framework and is designed to be simple,
modern, and type-safe.

### Hello, World!

```cs
using System;

class Program
{
	static void Main()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
	}
}
```
